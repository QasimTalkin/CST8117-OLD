			<h2>Birthday Celebrations</h2> 
		
			<p> 
                This is me, enjoying my time with friends playing 
                boardgames up at the family cottage. Every year 
                I like to have a large group of friends join 
                us at the cottage for a day filled with boardgames, 
                food, and swimming if the lake is warm enough. 
                Often we will have two or three different games 
                going at once.
